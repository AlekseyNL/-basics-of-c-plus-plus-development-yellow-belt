# Basics-of-C-plus-plus-Development-Yellow-Belt
## Basics of C++ Development: Yellow Belt by Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology &amp; Yandex.

This repository contains my solutions to tasks from [C++ course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/c-plus-plus-yellow).

The course covers:
- C ++ integer types
- couples and tuples
- function templates
- inheritance and polymorphism
- iterators and standard algorithms
- distribution of code across multiple files

In addition, the course discusses the use of unit tests for debugging programs and ensuring code reliability, and also demonstrates how  to develop your own unit test framework.
